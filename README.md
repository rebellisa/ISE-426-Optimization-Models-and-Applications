# ISE-426-Optimization-Models-and-Applications

This is a class project that I did when I took ISE 426 Optimization Models and Applications with Prof. Albert S. Berahas. Inspired by the navigation system for rideshare services like Uber and Lyft, we reformulated the navigation problem based on the shortest path problem. Meanwhile, we built a new model using greedy approach. The model we built aims to find the optimal sequence to send each customer to his or her desired destination and minimize the total distance travelled. The model based on the shortest path problem takes all nodes into consideration and find the total shortest distance. The model based on the greedy approach always serve the nearest customer first. Each time we add a new customer in the system, the driver will compare his location and the locations of all the unserved customers and search for the nearest one. As weâ€™re adding customers in later stage, the system elevated from a deterministic model to a dynamic model.
